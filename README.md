# CVD-Aware SVG Recoloring Tool

A signal-aware recoloring tool for making SVG data visualizations accessible to viewers with Color Vision Deficiency (CVD). Unlike global color filters that treat all colors uniformly, this tool understands what role colors play in encoding data and applies corrections that preserve the intended data signal.

The implementation follows the 6-phase decision tree architecture from the thesis (see `Thesis_Decision_Tree.svg`) and satisfies design requirements DR1-DR7 from Chapter 3.

## Why this exists

The key idea behind this thesis is that visualization accessibility needs to go beyond just making colors look different. Existing tools like Dalton and Colorize apply uniform color filters to web pages. They improve perceptual distinguishability, but they can destroy semantic information. For example, a diverging color scale's white midpoint (representing zero or neutrality) might shift to pink, causing viewers to misinterpret neutral values as slightly positive.

This tool asks "can this user still read the data?" rather than simply "can this user distinguish these colors?"

## What the tool preserves

The tool preserves different invariants depending on what type of data signal the visualization encodes.

For categorical palettes, every pair of category colors must remain perceptually distinguishable (CIEDE2000 ΔE >= 8). The failure mode here is pairwise collapse, where categories become indistinguishable under CVD.

For sequential palettes, L* values must be strictly ordered, equal data intervals should produce equal perceived color differences, and the gradient direction (light-to-dark or dark-to-light) must be maintained. Adjacent colors need to differ by at least ΔL* >= 3. Failure modes include monotonicity violation, uniformity distortion, and direction reversal.

For diverging palettes, the neutral midpoint must remain identifiable as the perceptual extremum, the two arms must remain distinct (endpoint ΔE > 10), and each arm must independently pass sequential tests. Failure modes include midpoint disappearance, midpoint shift, and bidirectional collapse.

## The 6-phase pipeline

Phase 1 parses the SVG and separates data marks (bars, areas, bubbles, map regions) from non-data elements (axes, labels, gridlines, titles). It extracts the color palette used for data encoding and identifies legend elements for later synchronization.

Phase 2 classifies the palette as categorical, sequential, or diverging using heuristics like L* shape analysis, pairwise ΔE patterns, and hue diversity.

Phase 3 counts categories, examines label types (numeric vs. string), analyzes color usage distribution, and for diverging palettes validates midpoint semantics.

Phase 4 checks if the classified palette type matches the extracted data signals. If there's a mismatch, it offers two paths: Path A repairs assuming the designer's palette type is correct, Path B repairs toward the data-appropriate palette type. It defaults to Path A in automated mode.

Phase 5 simulates the palette under the target CVD type using the Machado et al. (2009) model and runs the type-specific tests from the decision tree.

For categorical palettes: if all pairwise ΔE >= 8, it passes. Otherwise, if there are 8 or fewer categories it swaps in a CVD-safe palette (Okabe-Ito, IBM, Wong). For more than 8 categories it maximizes ΔE and flags for supplementary encoding.

For sequential palettes, it runs four tests in order: is L* monotonic, are steps uniform, is direction preserved, and is ΔL* >= 3 between steps.

For diverging palettes, it validates the midpoint semantic, checks midpoint extremum, endpoint separation, per-arm monotonicity, and arm symmetry.

Phase 6 re-simulates the repaired palette under CVD, verifies all invariants pass (iterating up to 3 times if needed), checks that non-data elements are unchanged, updates legend swatches to match data marks, and applies the repaired palette to the SVG DOM.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.8+ with numpy and lxml:

```bash
pip install numpy lxml
```

## Usage

```bash
# run on test SVGs (7 curated test cases)
python3 main.py test_svgs/ output/ --cvd deutan

# run on your own SVGs
python3 main.py input_svgs/ output/ --cvd deutan

# protanopia simulation
python3 main.py input_svgs/ output/ --cvd protan

# tritanopia simulation
python3 main.py input_svgs/ output/ --cvd tritan
```

CVD types: `protan` (protanopia, L-cone/red deficiency), `deutan` (deuteranopia, M-cone/green deficiency, the default), `tritan` (tritanopia, S-cone/blue deficiency).

## Output structure

```
output/
  corrected/      recolored SVGs (only files that needed correction)
  originals/      backup copies of originals that were corrected
  reports/        per-file JSON with all 6 phases logged
  summary.json    overall statistics
```

## Understanding the reports

Each JSON report in `output/reports/` documents all 6 phases. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "file": "election_map.svg",
  "cvd_type": "deutan",
  "status": "recolored",
  "phases": {
    "phase1": {
      "n_data_colors": 9,
      "original_palette": ["#d73027", "#f46d43", "#fdae61", "#fee08b", "#ffffbf"]
    },
    "phase2": {
      "palette_type": "diverging",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "details": { "is_v_shaped": true, "midpoint_index": 4 }
    },
    "phase5": {
      "tests_run": [
        { "name": "Diverging Test 1: Midpoint Extremum", "passed": true },
        { "name": "Diverging Test 2: Endpoint Separation", "passed": false,
          "value": 5.33, "threshold": 10.0 }
      ],
      "all_tests_passed": false
    }
  }
}
```

Status values: `passed` means already accessible, `recolored` means successfully repaired and verified, `recolored_with_warnings` means repaired but verification was incomplete, `skipped` means fewer than 2 data colors detected, `failed_to_recolor` means no passing palette could be generated, and `error` means a processing error occurred.

## Test cases

The `test_svgs/` folder contains 7 test cases spanning all three palette types, organized by how badly they degrade under CVD.

Already accessible (Tier 1): a blue+orange bar chart with ΔE=62.55, and a single-hue blue ramp with monotonic L*.

Partially degraded (Tier 2): a diverging palette-data mismatch case.

Severely degraded (Tier 3): a red/green/orange stacked bar with min ΔE=4.81, a green-yellow-red heatmap with L* reversal, an election-style diverging map with endpoint merge at ΔE=5.33, and a 6-color scatter with min ΔE=2.24.

Regenerate test cases with `python3 generate_tests.py`.

## Color science details

CVD simulation uses the Machado, Oliveira, and Fernandes (2009) physiologically-based model, which simulates anomalous trichromacy with variable severity by manipulating spectral absorption functions. This is more accurate than the older Brettel et al. (1997) projection method.

Color distance uses CIEDE2000 (Sharma et al. 2005), the current standard for perceptual color difference. Key thresholds: categorical pairwise minimum ΔE >= 8, diverging endpoint minimum ΔE > 10, sequential adjacent minimum ΔL* >= 3.

The tool includes embedded CVD-safe palettes for repairs: Okabe-Ito, IBM Design, and Wong for categorical; ColorBrewer blues, viridis, cividis, and inferno for sequential; and purple-orange, blue-red, and coolwarm variants for diverging.
